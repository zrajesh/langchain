DIABETES : 
Jyothi Vijayaraghavan; Judy S. Crabtree, PhD.  
Diabetes mellitus, or simply diabetes , is a chronic disease affecting about 25.8 million people in the United States 
making it the seventh leading cause of death.  
What is Diabetes?  
Diabetes is a met abolic disorder in which there are high levels of sugar in the blood, a condition called 
hyperglycemia. Under normal conditions, food is broken down to glucose which then enters the bloodstream and 
acts as fuel for the body. The p ancreas produces a hormone  called insulin which helps to carry glucose from the 
bloodstream into muscle, fat and liver where it can be used as fuel. Diabetics are not able to move this sugar out 
of the bloodstream because of two primary reasons: 1) their pancreas do es not produce e nough insulin and/or 2) 
their cells do  not respond normally to insulin , a condition called insulin resistance . This is why  people with 
diabetes have high blood sugar  levels .  
  
 
Types of diabetes:  
1) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) / Juvenile diabetes/ Insulin dependen t diabetes:  T1D affects both adults and 
children at any age and occurs when the person’s pancreas stop producing insulin  due to destruction of 
the pancreatic beta cells or by inactivity of these insulin -producing cells . Affected individuals depend on 
daily  injections of insulin  to maintain normal blood glucose levels . The causes of T1D  are not entirely 
understood however; scientists believe that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.  
2) Type 2 diabetes/ Non -insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( T2D or NIDDM):  This is the most common 
form of diabetes that most often occu rs in adulthood. However, because of increased obesity rates and 
sedentary lifestyles,  teens and young adults are also being diagnosed with T2D or the precursor, pre -Source: http://www.natural -homeremedies.com/blog/top -8-risk-factors -of-type-2-diabetes/  diabetes. In T2D, fat, muscle and liver cells do  not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin 
resistance. As a result, blood sugar cannot enter these cells to be stored for energy and build s up in the 
blood. Insulin resistance is a gradual process that develop s slowly over time.  
3) Gestational diabetes:  This refers to diabetes that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. As many as  eight 
out of 100 pregnant women in the U.S develop gestational diabetes. Weight gain and changing hormones 
that occur during pregnancy  can impair insulin function,  resulting in high blood sugar. This form of 
diabetes usually disappears after pregnancy, however, women who have had gestational diabetes have a 
40-60% chance of developing T2D within 5 to 10 years.  
 
Risk factors for Diabetes:  The following factors contribute to the risk of developing diabetes - 
Type 1 diabetes –  
1) Family history of diabetes  
2) Disease of the pancreas  
3) Infection or illness that affects the pancreas  
 
Type 2 diabetes –  
1) Obesity  
2) Family history of diabetes  
3) History of g estational diabetes  
4) Ethnic background - African Americans, Native americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans 
have a higher risk for  developing diabetes.  
5) Old age  
6) Hypertension  
 
Gestational diabetes – 
1) Family history of diabetes  
2) Being overweight before  becoming pregnant  
3) Belonging to a high risk ethnic group (as mentioned above)  
4) Having gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy  
5) Giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds  
 
 
Symptoms:  
 
1. Type 1 diabetes – Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short perio d of time and include weight 
loss, frequent urination, excessive thirst and hunger, weakness and fatigue, nausea and vomiting.  
 
2. Type 2 diabetes – Symptoms develop slowly with some people showing no symptoms at all. They include 
any of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes, blurred vision, hard to heal skin, gum or bladder infections, and 
tingling or numbness in the hands or feet.   
3. Gestational diabetes – Symptoms may or may not develop during pregnancy and therefore individuals 
need to be tested for the condition.   Symptoms are same as for type 2 diabetes.  
 
Complications of diabetes:  If not cared for appropriately, it may lead to the following complications – 
 
1. Kidney disease ( Diabetic nephropathy)  
2. Blindness (Diabetic retinopathy)  
3. Heart disease and stroke. Diabeti cs are 2 to 4 times more likely to have a heart disease and suffer a stroke.  
4. Nerve damage  
5. Sores on feet and skin possibly resulting in amputations  
6. Diabetic coma due to extremely high blood sugar  
 
 
Diabetes statistics in Louisiana:  
 
 
Louisiana is ranked 1 1th in the naton for people diagnosed with diabetes and has the 2nd highest diabetes mortality 
rate. The prevalence of diabetes within the state  has steadily increased from 6.6% to 10.3% between the years 
2000 to 2010. Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death among Louisiana residents. Furthermore, African 
Americans compose nearly 32% of Louisiana’s population and have the highest prevalence of diabetes .  African 
Americans are diagnosed at a rate of 12.9% , as compared to 8.1% of Hispanics and 9.2% of Caucasians living in 
Source: Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS), 2010  Louisiana . In 2010, total cost of hospitalization  for people with diabetes  and diabetic complications  in Louisiana 
was approximately $231,000,000. Louisiana has also been identified as one of the states with a portion of its 
counties in the Diabetes belt  by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This belt has higher rates 
of obesity and physical inactivity and therefore , a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than the rest of the 
country.  
 
 
How is Diabetes diagnose d?  
1. Fasting blood glucose level – It is the preferred method of determining diabetes in children and non -
pregnant adults. Diabetes is diagnosed if blood glucose level is 126 milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL) or 
higher after an 8 -hour fast. Levels between 10 0-126 mg/dL are considered prediabetes, a condition where 
individuals have high blood sugar but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Individuals with 
prediabetes have higher elevated  risk of developing T2D. 
2. Hemoglobin A1c test – This is a blood te st that shows how well you are controlling diabetes. It shows the 
average level of blood glucose over the previous 3 months.  
3. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) – This is a test to check how well your body breaks down sugar. 
Diabetes is diagnosed if blood g lucose level is 200mg/dL or higher after drinking a beverage containing 
75 grams of glucose dissolved in water.  
 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on blood glucose levels measured during the OGTT. Screening for type 2 
diabetes in people who have no s ymptoms is recommended for overweight children, overweight adults who have 
other risk factors and adults over the age of 45.  
 
Treatment and management of diabetes:  
Although there is no cure for diabetes, treatment and control of diabetes involves the follo wing:  
1. Insulin injections  
2. Weight loss  
3. Constant monitoring of blood glucose through frequent blood 
glucose tests or self -monitoring equipments such as 
glucometers.   
4. Oral medications (recommended by physician) to lower blood 
glucose  
5. Healthy diet including fo ods with fewer calories, an even amount of carbohydrates and healthy 
monostaurated fats. Patients should work with their doctor or dietician to design a meal plan to maintain 
near-normal blood glucose levels.  
6. Exercise  
In all, a healthy lifestyle, insulin a nd oral medications to maintain normal glucose levels are the foundations of 
diabetes management and treatment.
